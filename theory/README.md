# Theory

This is where I will theorize about Grapheme's technologies and how to implement them. I won't *try* to make the text accessible to others, but since I need to be able to understand it however many months from now, it will be explained relatively completely.

Documenting things like this worked rather well for my Tones project last time. Furthermore, it helps me check for errors and/or completeness. If there is one lesson that APUSH summer homework has taught me so far, it is that writing things down is an effective way to internalize and fully understand information.

Why am I talking to myself?
