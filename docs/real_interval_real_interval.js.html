 * This file defines interval arithmetic functions.
 * @module RealIntervals
 * */

/** A real interval is, à la Jeff Tupper's groundbreaking 2001
 * SIGGRAPH paper, a closed interval that is a (not necessarily strict) superset of a set of real numbers. The minimum
 * is stored in the variable min, and the maximum is stored in the variable max. The set of
 * all real numbers can be represented with the interval [-inf, inf]. Tupper also adds four additional properties,
 * here named defMin, defMax, contMin, and contMax. If defMin = defMax = true, then the number represented is entirely
 * DEFINED. If defMin = false and defMax = true, then we are unsure whether the number is defined. If
 * defMin = defMax = false, then the number is definitely undefined.
 *
 * The reason this is useful is to encapsulate the notion of a function being undefined. For example, sqrt([-1, -0.5])
 * is entirely undefined, so defMin = defMax = false. In other words, if x is in [-1, -0.5], we KNOW that sqrt(x) is
 * undefined – at least among the real numbers. But if x is in [-1, 1], we don't know for sure that sqrt(x) is defined,
 * so defMin = false and defMax = true for sqrt([-1, 1]).
 *
 * contMin and contMax are the same thing, but for continuity. Some functions are defined everywhere, but discontinuous.
 * A good example is the floor function. floor([-1, 1]) is always defined, so defMin = defMax = true, but contMin =
 * false and contMax = true. Undefinedness implies discontinuity, not the other way around. That is, if defMin = false,
 * that will take precedence over contMin = true; the value of contMin is immaterial in that case.
 *
 * There is also the class RealIntervalSet, which represents a set of intervals. See that class for more information.
 *
 * In normal Grapheme usage, an undefined RealInterval is simply represented with defMin = defMax = false. null should
 * never be passed to a function as a RealInterval; it will almost certainly throw an error.
 *
 * tl;dr: Six parameters, namely min, max, defMin, defMax, contMin, contMax. min and max are numbers which represent the
 * bounds of the interval, and the remaining four parameters are booleans that provide extra context for the meaning of
 * the interval.

export class RealInterval {
  /**
   * Construct a RealInterval. Only a single argument is needed, and will produce an "exact interval", but there are
   * six arguments in total. The meaning of each argument is described in the class description.
   * @param min {number}
   * @param max {number}
   * @param defMin {boolean}
   * @param defMax {boolean}
   * @param contMin {boolean}
   * @param contMax {boolean}
   */
  constructor (min, max = min, defMin = true, defMax = true, contMin = true, contMax = true) {
    /** {number} */
    this.min = min
    /** {number} */
    this.max = max
    /** {boolean} */
    this.defMin = defMin
    /** {boolean} */
    this.defMax = defMax
    /** {boolean} */
    this.contMin = contMin
    /** {boolean} */
    this.contMax = contMax
  }
}

/** Some functions, such as f(x) = 1/x, may
 * have to return wider intervals than ideal for certain inputs. f([-1, 1]) = [-inf, inf, defMin=false, defMin=true],
 * and there is no tighter bound. The solution is to return a SET of intervals, which together cover the solution set.
 * In this case, there would be three (not two) intervals returned. The intervals are [-inf, -1], [1, inf], and
 * [NaN, NaN, defMin=false, defMin=false]. The first two intervals cover the defined possibilities; the last interval
 * covers the fact that 1/0 is undefined.
 *
 * RealIntervalSet is equipped with defMin, defMax, contMin, and contMax functions just like a RealInterval, but they
 * should not be used in performance-intensive situations, because they are getters (which are known to be exceedingly
 * slow). They are calculated; defMin is the logical AND of each interval, and defMax is the logical OR of each
 * interval, and the same is true for contMin and contMax.
 *
 * All exposed interval functions accept both RealIntervals and RealIntervalSets. For performant testing of whether an
 * argument is a RealInterval or Set, the function isSet() can be used. RealIntervalSets CANNOT be nested; they should
 * always be flattened. If a set becomes too fat, it must be MERGED. This can be done in a lossless or lossy fashion.
 * Lossless merging happens when intervals are merged in a way such that the resulting set is exactly equivalent
 * mathematically to the original. For example, [-1, 1] u [1, 4] can be losslessly merged to [-1, 4]. Note that this
 * merging needs to account for differing defMin and defMax values. For example, [-1, 1, defMin=false, defMax=true] u
 * [1, 4, defMin=true, defMax=true] CANNOT be losslessly merged to [-1, 4, defMin=false, defMax=true]; this is a lossy
 * conversion. Obviously, lossless merging is preferred over lossy merging, but the latter might be necessary. In the
 * most extreme case, the interval [-inf, inf, defMin=false, defMax=true, contMin=false, contMax=true] is a valid
 * superset and lossy merge of ANY interval set. The maximum acceptable size for a RealIntervalSet is
 * maxRealIntervalSetSize.
 *
 * As with the RealInterval, an undefined RealIntervalSet is just a RealIntervalSet containing a single undefined
 * RealInterval. */
