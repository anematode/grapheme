# Grapheme
Another grapher for the web. The goal is to create a "graphing calculator" which is faster, more customizable and more versatile than today's current web standard. But let's be honest, it's just gonna be another one of my unfinished passion projects.

You'll need rollup to build this. Install rollup with:

```
npm install --global rollup
```

Then you can run build.sh, which will dump the grapheme JS and CSS in the build/ folder. The most recent build, however, is already in build.
